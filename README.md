# Filtering-in-Spatial-and-Frequency-Domains
Implementation and comparison of Box and Gaussian filters in spatial and frequency domains using Python (NumPy FFT). Filters applied on lena.png; results compared visually and via Mean Absolute Difference (MAD &lt; 1e−7) to verify spatial–frequency equivalence.
